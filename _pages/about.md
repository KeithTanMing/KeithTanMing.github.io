I'm an aspiring data scientist, with a voracious appetite to drive business processes and decision making through data insights. Having had 3 years of tech ecosystem development experience, and a passion for - and graduated in - econometrics modelling and data, the plunge into data science was natural, if not expected. 

I seek opportunities to wrangle with data in the most creative, effective and pragmatic way possible, to drive decision making.
